How is this project different than SpecWatchr?
It adds support for VB .NET projects and does not require Growl to be running at system startup.

SpecWatchr 
=======================
Getting started with SpecWatchr and associated videos can be found here:

[Continous Testing with SpecWatchr](http://nspec.org/continuoustesting)

=====

To get this running quickly, install Growl for Windows and Ruby.

Download from this project:

- dotnet.watchr.rb
- watcher_dot_net.rb
- sidekick.bat
- sidekick.cs
- green.png
- red.png

Place the downloaded files in the base directory of your solution.  You'll need to follow the naming conventions in the SpecWatchr project.

To run this, run the batch file named sidekick.bat inside your solution.  You may find it helpful to run it from your Solution Explorer.
